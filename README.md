# RestaurantMenu

<h2>This app has been developed to meet the need of the restaurants on my city that have a .pdf with the menu.<h2>
<h2>This is a problem because is very tedious to the owners to update the prices every time they have to. Due to the constant changes on prices on my country Argentina <h2>

<h3>The website is just one page with the information of everything on the menu, with a very easy set up to update pricing and add new dishes</h3>
<h3>It has a navbar on the top to access different sections of the menu, an option to add the amount of food you want so you have an easy way to remember the things when the server cames to the table</h3>

<h3>It was developed on react-bootstrap and redux for the cart section. It's a simple design but one that solves a problem</h3>
